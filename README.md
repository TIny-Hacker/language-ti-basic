## About
This extension provides syntax highlighting and snippets (provided by [Hamburger317](https://github.com/Hamburger317)) for the z80 TI-BASIC language. This extension is meant specifically for the TI-84 Plus CE/83 Premium CE calculators, though it may work with others as well. Other useful features may be added in the future!

## FAQ
 * Q: Why can't I load my file in VSCode?<br/>
   A: The files on the calculator are not normal text files, they are binary files consisting of tokens which are represented by text in the TI-BASIC editor. To open a file from the calculator, you need to convert it using an tool like [SourceCoder](https://cemetech.net/sc).
 * Q: Why can't I send my file to the calculator?<br/>
   A: See the above question.
